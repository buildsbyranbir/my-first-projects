        <h3>My Memorable Trip to Cox's Bazar</h3>
        <p>Last month, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Cox’s Bazar, the world’s longest natural sandy sea
            beach. The moment I arrived, I was mesmerized by the endless stretch of golden sand meeting the deep blue
            waves of the Bay of Bengal.</p>
        <p>As I stepped onto the beach, the fresh sea breeze instantly refreshed me. The sound of crashing waves was so
            soothing that I forgot all my worries. The beach was lively—locals and tourists were enjoying walks, horse
            rides, and even beach football. The sunset was breathtaking, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.
        </p>

        <p>I couldn’t resist dipping my feet into the cool seawater. The waves were strong but fun to play with. I also
            tried some delicious street food like fuchka and grilled seafood from the beachside stalls. One of the
            highlights was riding a speedboat near Laboni Point, which gave me an adrenaline rush as we sped over the
            waves.</p>
